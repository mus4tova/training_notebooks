# training_projects

These small notebooks were created at the beginning of my prefessional journey to familiarize myself with classical machine learning algorithms, strengthen my skills, gain practical experience, and better understand the essence and principles of core ML algorithms. Later, as I progressed professionally, I made some improvements to my initial projects, increased the metrics, and added deeper data analysis.

1. Titanic: binary classification task; exploratory data analysis (EDA); models: keras neural network, random forest and logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning.

2. Credit card fraud detection: binary classification task / anomaly detection; EDA; models: naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, boosting (AdaBoost, catboost), convolutional neural network, autoencoder with threshold tuning

3. Iris species: multiclass classification task; KNeighborsClassifier, naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, LinearSVC
